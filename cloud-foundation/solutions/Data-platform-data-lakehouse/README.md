## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
You can effectively collect and analyze event data and streaming data from internet of things (IoT) and social media sources, but how do you correlate it with the broad range of enterprise data resources to leverage your investment and gain the insights you want?

Leverage a cloud data lakehouse that combines the abilities of a data lake and a data warehouse to process a broad range of enterprise and streaming data for business analysis and machine learning.

A data lake enables an enterprise to store all of its data in a cost-effective, elastic environment while providing the necessary processing, persistence, and analytic services to discover new business insights. A data lake stores and curates structured and unstructured data and provides methods for organizing large volumes of highly diverse data from multiple sources.

With a data warehouse, you perform data transformation and cleansing before you commit the data to the warehouse. With a a data lake, you ingest data quickly and prepare it on the fly as people access it. A data lake supports operational reporting and business monitoring that require immediate access to data and flexible analysis to understand what is happening in the business while it is happening.

For details of the architecture, see [_Data platform - data lakehouse_](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/data-platform-lakehouse/).

## <a name="deliverables"></a>Deliverables
 This repository encloses one deliverable:

- A reference implementation written in Terraform HCL (Hashicorp Language) that provisions fully functional resources in an OCI tenancy.

## <a name="architecture"></a>Architecture-Diagram

**Functional Architecture:**

This architecture combines the abilities of a data lake and a data warehouse to provide a modern data lakehouse platform that processes streaming data and other types of data from a broad range of enterprise data resources. Use this architecture to leverage the data for business analysis, machine learning, data services, and data products.

![](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/data-platform-lakehouse/img/lakehouse-functional.png)


**Physical Architecture:**

The physical architecture for this data lakehouse supports the following:

- Data is ingested securely by using micro batch, streaming, APIs, and files from relational and non-relational data sources
- Data is processed leveraging a combination of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Integration and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Flow
- Data is stored in Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage and is organized according to its quality and value
- ADW serves warehouse and lake data services securely to consumers
- Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) surfaces data to business users by using visualizations
- OAC is exposed by using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Load Balancing that is secured by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide access by using the internet
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science is used to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Gateway is leveraged to govern the Data Science ML model deployments
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Catalog harvests metadata from ADW and object storage
- Oracle Data Safe evaluates risks to data, implements and monitors security controls, assesses user security, monitors user activity, and addresses data security compliance requirements
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Bastion is used by administrators to manage private cloud resources

The following diagram illustrates this reference architecture.

# <a name="Deploy-Using-the-Terraform-CLI"></a>Deploy Using the Terraform CLI

## Clone the Module
Now, you'll want a local copy of this repo. You can make that with the commands:

    git clone https://github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-oracle-cloud-foundation.git
    cd terraform-oci-oracle-cloud-foundation/cloud-foundation/solutions/Data-platform-data-lakehouse
    ls

## Deployment

- Follow the instructions from Prerequisites links in order to install terraform.
- Download the terraform version suitable for your operating system.
- Unzip the archive.
- Add the executable to the PATH.
- You will have to generate an API signing key (public/private keys) and the public key should be uploaded in the OCI console, for the iam user that will be used to create the resources. Also, you should make sure that this user has enough permissions to create resources in OCI. In order to generate the API Signing key, follow the steps from: https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#How
  The API signing key will generate a fingerprint in the OCI console, and that fingerprint will be used in a terraform file described below.
- You will also need to generate an OpenSSH public key pair. Please store those keys in a place accessible like your user home .ssh directory.

## Prerequisites

- Install Terraform v0.13 or greater: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
- Install Python 3.6: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-centos-7
- Generate an OCI API Key
- Create your config under \$home*directory/.oci/config (run \_oci setup config* and follow the steps)
- Gather Tenancy related variables (tenancy_id, user_id, local path to the oci_api_key private key, fingerprint of the oci_api_key_public key, and region)
- Make sure you have docker installed or install it.
- Generate an Auth Token for the Container Registry

### Installing Terraform

Go to [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and download the proper package for your operating system and architecture. Terraform is distributed as a single binary.
Install Terraform by unzipping it and moving it to a directory included in your system's PATH. You will need the latest version available.

### Prepare Terraform Provider Values

**variables.tf** is located in the root directory. This file is used in order to be able to make API calls in OCI, hence it will be needed by all terraform automations.

In order to populate the **variables.tf** file, you will need the following:

- Tenancy OCID
- User OCID
- Local Path to your private oci api key
- Fingerprint of your public oci api key
- Region

#### **Getting the Tenancy and User OCIDs**

You will have to login to the [console](https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com) using your credentials (tenancy name, user name and password). If you do not know those, you will have to contact a tenancy administrator.

In order to obtain the tenancy ocid, after logging in, from the menu, select Administration -> Tenancy Details. The tenancy OCID, will be found under Tenancy information and it will be similar to **ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaâ€¦**

In order to get the user ocid, after logging in, from the menu, select Identity -> Users. Find your user and click on it (you will need to have this page open for uploading the oci_api_public_key). From this page, you can get the user OCID which will be similar to **ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaâ€¦**

#### **Creating the OCI API Key Pair and Upload it to your user page**

Create an oci_api_key pair in order to authenticate to oci as specified in the [documentation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#How):

Create the .oci directory in the home of the current user

`$ mkdir ~/.oci`

Generate the oci api private key

`$ openssl genrsa -out ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem 2048`

Make sure only the current user can access this key

`$ chmod go-rwx ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem`

Generate the oci api public key from the private key

`$ openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem -out ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem`

You will have to upload the public key to the oci console for your user (go to your user page -> API Keys -> Add Public Key and paste the contents in there) in order to be able to do make API calls.

After uploading the public key, you can see its fingerprint into the console. You will need that fingerprint for your variables.tf file.
You can also get the fingerprint from running the following command on your local workstation by using your newly generated oci api private key.

`$ openssl rsa -pubout -outform DER -in ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem | openssl md5 -c`

#### **Generating an SSH Key Pair on UNIX or UNIX-Like Systems Using ssh-keygen**

- Run the ssh-keygen command.

`ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa`

- The command prompts you to enter the path to the file in which you want to save the key. A default path and file name are suggested in parentheses. For example: /home/user_name/.ssh/id_rsa. To accept the default path and file name, press Enter. Otherwise, enter the required path and file name, and then press Enter.
- The command prompts you for a passphrase. Enter a passphrase, or press ENTER if you don't want to havea passphrase.
  Note that the passphrase isn't displayed when you type it in. Remember the passphrase. If you forget the passphrase, you can't recover it. When prompted, enter the passphrase again to confirm it.
- The command generates an SSH key pair consisting of a public key and a private key, and saves them in the specified path. The file name of the public key is created automatically by appending .pub to the name of the private key file. For example, if the file name of the SSH private key is id_rsa, then the file name of the public key would be id_rsa.pub.
  Make a note of the path where you've saved the SSH key pair.
  When you create instances, you must provide the SSH public key. When you log in to an instance, you must specify the corresponding SSH private key and enter the passphrase when prompted.

#### **Getting the Region**

Even though, you may know your region name, you will needs its identifier for the variables.tf file (for example, US East Ashburn has us-ashburn-1 as its identifier).
In order to obtain your region identifier, you will need to Navigate in the OCI Console to Administration -> Region Management
Select the region you are interested in, and save the region identifier.

#### **Prepare the variables.tf file**

You will have to modify the **variables.tf** file to reflect the values that youâ€™ve captured.

```
variable "tenancy_ocid" {
  type = string
  default = "" (tenancy ocid, obtained from OCI console - Profile -> Tenancy)
}

variable "region" {
    type = string
    default = "" (the region used for deploying the infrastructure - ex: eu-frankfurt-1)
}

variable "compartment_id" {
  type = string
  default = "" (the compartment used for deploying the solution - ex: compartment1)
}

variable "user_ocid" {
    type = string
    default = "" (user ocid, obtained from OCI console - Profile -> User Settings)
}

variable "fingerprint" {
    type = string
    default = "" (fingerprint obtained after setting up the API public key in OCI console - Profile -> User Settings -> API Keys -> Add Public Key)
}

variable "private_key_path" {
    type = string
    default = ""  (the path of your local oci api key - ex: /root/.ssh/oci_api_key.pem)
}
```

Additionally you'll need to do some pre-deploy setup for Docker and Fn Project inside your machine:

```
sudo su -
yum update
yum install yum-utils
yum-config-manager --enable *addons
yum install docker-engine
groupadd docker
service docker restart
usermod -a -G docker opc
chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
exit
curl -LSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fnproject/cli/master/install | sh
exit
```

For MacOS you can use colima as an option to have docker started.


### __Last additional prerequisites are:__
1. __Generate an Auth Token for the Container Registry__
  
  - In the top-right corner of the Console, open the User menu (User menu), and then click User Settings.
  - On the Auth Tokens page, click Generate Token.
  - Enter Tutorial auth token as a friendly description for the auth token and click Generate Token. The new auth token is displayed.
  - Copy the auth token immediately to a secure location from where you can retrieve it later, because you won't see the auth token again in the Console.
  - Close the Generate Token dialog. This token will be required for the ocir_user_password variable.
  - The code will create a repository for your artifacts inside the container registry service. Inside the repository the code will create a docker image that will be used as a function.

2. __Check your username format__ 
 - "tenancy-namespace>/username". For example, ansh81vru1zp/jdoe@acme.com. If your tenancy is federated with Oracle Identity Cloud Service, use the format tenancy-namespace/oracleidentitycloudservice/username. 
 - As the tenancy-namespace terraform will get it automatically, just verify if your tenancy it's federated or not. 
 - If it's federated remember the oracleidentitycloudservice/username format. For example: oracleidentitycloudservice/ionel_panaitescu . This will be required for the ocir_user_name variable.


## Repository files

* **functions(folder)** - In this folder all the neccesary files to create the Docker Image that will be pushed to the Container Registry. This Docker Image will decode all the messages from the StreamPool to the object storage.
* **modules(folder)** - ( this folder will be pressent only for the Resource Manager zipped files) Contains folders with subsystems and modules for each section of the project: networking, autonomous database, analytics cloud, etc.
* **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contributing guidelines, also called Contribution guidelines, the CONTRIBUTING.md file, or software contribution guidelines, is a text file which project managers include in free and open-source software packages or other open media packages for the purpose of describing how others may contribute user-generated content to the project.The file explains how anyone can engage in activities such as formatting code for submission or submitting patches
* **LICENSE** - The Universal Permissive License (UPL), Version 1.0 
* **local.tf** - Local values can be helpful to avoid repeating the same values or expressions multiple times in a configuration, but if overused they can also make a configuration hard to read by future maintainers by hiding the actual values used.Here is the place where all the resources are defined.
* **main.tf** - Main Terraform script used for instantiating the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider and all subsystems modules
* **outputs.tf** - Defines project's outputs that you will see after the code runs successfuly
* **provider.tf** - The terraform provider that will be used (OCI)
* **README.md** - This file
* **schema.yaml** - Schema documents are recommended for Terraform configurations when using Resource Manager. Including a schema document allows you to extend pages in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. Facilitate variable entry in the Create Stack page by surfacing SSH key controls and by naming, grouping, dynamically prepopulating values, and more. Define text in the Application Information tab of the stack detail page displayed for a created stack.
* **tags.tf** - A file that will add tags for all the resouces as ArchitectureCenterTagNamespace convention.
* **variables.tf** - Project's global variables


Secondly, populate the `terraform.tf` file with the disared configuration following the information:


# Autonomous Data Warehouse

The ADW subsystem / module is able to create ADW/ATP databases.

* Parameters:
    * __db_name__ - The database name. The name must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of 14 alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not permitted. The database name must be unique in the tenancy.
    * __db_password__ - The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long, and must contain at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 numeric character. It cannot contain the double quote symbol (") or the username "admin", regardless of casing. The password is mandatory if source value is "BACKUP_FROM_ID", "BACKUP_FROM_TIMESTAMP", "DATABASE" or "NONE".
    * __db_cpu_core_count__ - The number of OCPU cores to be made available to the database. For Autonomous Databases on dedicated Exadata infrastructure, the maximum number of cores is determined by the infrastructure shape. See Characteristics of Infrastructure Shapes for shape details.
    * __db_size_in_tbs__ - The size, in gigabytes, of the data volume that will be created and attached to the database. This storage can later be scaled up if needed. The maximum storage value is determined by the infrastructure shape. See Characteristics of Infrastructure Shapes for shape details.
    * __db_workload__ - The Autonomous Database workload type. The following values are valid:
        - OLTP - indicates an Autonomous Transaction Processing database
        - DW - indicates an Autonomous Data Warehouse database
        - AJD - indicates an Autonomous JSON Database
        - APEX - indicates an Autonomous Database with the Oracle APEX Application Development workload type. *Note: db_workload can only be updated from AJD to OLTP or from a free OLTP to AJD.
    * __db_version__ - A valid Oracle Database version for Autonomous Database.db_workload AJD and APEX are only supported for db_version 19c and above.
    * __db_enable_auto_scaling__ - Indicates if auto scaling is enabled for the Autonomous Database OCPU core count. The default value is FALSE.
    * __db_is_free_tier__ - Indicates if this is an Always Free resource. The default value is false. Note that Always Free Autonomous Databases have 1 CPU and 20GB of memory. For Always Free databases, memory and CPU cannot be scaled. When db_workload is AJD or APEX it cannot be true.
    * __db_license_model__ - The Oracle license model that applies to the Oracle Autonomous Database. Bring your own license (BYOL) allows you to apply your current on-premises Oracle software licenses to equivalent, highly automated Oracle PaaS and IaaS services in the cloud. License Included allows you to subscribe to new Oracle Database software licenses and the Database service. Note that when provisioning an Autonomous Database on dedicated Exadata infrastructure, this attribute must be null because the attribute is already set at the Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure level. When using shared Exadata infrastructure, if a value is not specified, the system will supply the value of BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE. It is a required field when db_workload is AJD and needs to be set to LICENSE_INCLUDED as AJD does not support default license_model value BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE.

Below is an example:

```
variable "db_name" {
  type    = string
  default = "ADWDataLake"
}

variable "db_password" {
  type = string
  default = "<enter-password-here>"
}

variable "db_cpu_core_count" {
  type = number
  default = 1
}

variable "db_size_in_tbs" {
  type = number
  default = 1
}

variable "db_workload" {
  type = string
  default = "DW"
}

variable "db_version" {
  type = string
  default = "19c"
}

variable "db_enable_auto_scaling" {
  type = bool
  default = true
}

variable "db_is_free_tier" {
  type = bool
  default = false
}

variable "db_license_model" {
  type = string
  default = "BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE"
}
```

#  API Gateway service

This resource provides the Gateway resource and the Deployment resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Gateway service.Creates a new gateway and a new deployment.

* Parameters
    * __apigw_display_name__ -  (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: My new resource
    * __apigwdeploy_display_name__ - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: My new resource


Below is an example in the variables.tf File.
```
variable "apigw_display_name" {
  default = "Lakehouse_ApiGW"
}

variable "apigwdeploy_display_name" {
  default = "Lakehouse_deployment"
}
```

The Api Gateway provides many features - you can also add function deployment type. Below it's an example that can be used if you already have a function deployed inside your tenancy. Go inside the local.tf file at the API Gateway section and you can use this code where function_id is your function name or function ocid.
Below is an example:
```

apigw_params = {
  apigw = {
    compartment_id = var.compartment_id,
    endpoint_type  = "PRIVATE"
    subnet_id      = lookup(module.network-subnets.subnets,"private_subnet_application").id
    display_name   = var.apigw_display_name
    defined_tags   = { "${oci_identity_tag_namespace.ArchitectureCenterTagNamespace.name}.${oci_identity_tag.ArchitectureCenterTag.name}" = var.release }
  }
}

# Streaming Service

This resource provides the Stream Pool resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming service.
Also this resource provides the Service Connector resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Service Connector Hub service.

Creates a new service connector in the specified compartment. A service connector is a logically defined flow for moving data from a source service to a destination service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For general information about service connectors, see Service Connector Hub Overview.

* Parameters:
    * __stream_name__ - The name of the stream. Avoid entering confidential information.
    * __stream_partitions__ - The number of partitions in the stream.
    * __stream_retention_in_hours__ -  The retention period of the stream, in hours. Accepted values are between 24 and 168 (7 days). If not specified, the stream will have a retention period of 24 hours.
    * __stream_pool_name__ - The name of the stream pool. Avoid entering confidential information

Below is an example:

```

# Streaming

variable "stream_name" {
    type    = string
    default = "Test_Stream"
}

variable "stream_partitions" {
    type    = string
    default = "1"
}

variable "stream_retention_in_hours" {
    type    = string
    default = "24"
}
  
variable "stream_pool_name" {
    type    = string
    default = "Test_Stream_Pool"
}
```

The streaming module also has the service connector hub integrated and you can use it if you have a function already in your tenancy available. For this solution only the stream pool and 1 stream will be provisioned.

For this you need to go into the local.tf file and for the service_connector object to be replaced with the code below and also to set in the variables.tf file the rest of the variables detailed upper.
Also you need to replace the : function_id with your function name or function ocid from your tenancy.
